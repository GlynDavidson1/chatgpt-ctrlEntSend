# Privacy Policy
Last updated: November 16th 2025

## 1. Overview
ChatGPT Enter Key Remap is a lightweight Chrome extension that modifies the keyboard behavior on the ChatGPT website.
The extension does not collect, store, transmit, or share any personal data.

Your privacy is fully respected, and no information ever leaves your browser.

## 2. Information We Collect
We do not collect any information.
Specifically:
No personal data
No browsing history
No keystrokes
No session data
No content from ChatGPT conversations
No analytics
No identifiers
No telemetry of any kind

Zero collection. Zero storage. Zero transmission.

## 3. Permissions
The extension requires access to:
https://chatgpt.com/*
This is required solely to run the content script that remaps the Enter and Shift+Enter keys inside ChatGPT’s message editor.

The extension is intentionally limited to this domain so it cannot run on any other website or affect the user’s browser elsewhere.

It does not have access to, nor does it attempt to read, modify, or monitor any user data.

## 4. How the Extension Works
The extension performs only one function:
Changing the keyboard behavior inside ChatGPT’s input box (Enter → newline, Ctrl+Enter → send)

The logic runs entirely on your machine.
Nothing is processed or transmitted to any external servers.

## 5. Third-Party Services
The extension does not use or integrate with:
Advertising networks
Analytics platforms
Cloud services
Third-party APIs
External servers

You interact solely with your own browser and the ChatGPT site.

## 6. Data Sharing
Because no data is collected, no data can be shared.
We do not share, sell, or disclose anything to any third party.

## 7. Children’s Privacy
The extension does not target or collect data from anyone, including children under 13.

## 8. Changes to This Policy
Any future changes to this policy will be updated on this page.
Since no data is collected, changes are expected to be minimal.
